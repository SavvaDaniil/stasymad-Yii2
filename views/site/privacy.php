            </p>

            <p>
            We do not currently maintain any procedures for you to review the information that we collect about you.

            <h6>Retention of personal information</h6>

            <p>
            When you close or de-activate your account or if your account is otherwise terminated, we have the right, but not the obligation, 
            to store your personal information, settings, saved and completed classes, and teachers you have followed.
            </p>

            <h6>Information Security</h6>

            <p>
            ‍We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, 
            disclosure or destruction of data. These include internal reviews of our data collection, storage and processing practices 
            and security measures, as well as physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems 
            where we store personal data.
            </p>

            <p>
            We restrict access to personal information to STASYMAD Online Platform employees, contractors and agents who need 
            to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve our services. These individuals are bound by 
            confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, 
            if they fail to meet these obligations.

            either to correct this data if it is inaccurate or to delete such data at your request if it is not otherwise 
            required to be retained by law or for legitimate business purposes. We ask individual users to identify themselves 
            and the information requested to be accessed, corrected or removed before processing such requests, 
            and we may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, 
            jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical 
            (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup tapes), or for which access is not otherwise required. 
            In any case where we provide information access and correction, we perform this service free of charge, 
            except if doing so would require a disproportionate effort.
